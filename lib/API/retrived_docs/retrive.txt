more money by buying a chicken and selling its eggs. She started to think how 
jealous she could make the other milkmaid with all the things she could buy from 
the milk and egg money. She started to skip in excitement, and soon the milk 
spilled over. She went home with empty pails and no money. Her mother then 
reminds her that she shouldn’t count her chicken until they hatch.
Moral: Do not depend on something until you are sure it will happen.
6. A Wise Old Owl
An old owl would observe incidents happening around his oak tree every day. The 
more things he saw, the less he would speak. He heard people talking and sharing 
stories as well. The old owl had seen so much and heard all kinds of stories. 
All of these experiences helped the owl to become wiser day by day.

3. The Fox and the Grapes
A hungry fox once looked everywhere for food. He couldn’t find anything until he 
stumbled upon a farmer’s wall. He saw big, purple, juicy grapes. He jumped as 
high as possible to reach the grapes. No matter how many times he tried, he 
failed. Finally, he gave up and went home, thinking to himself that the grapes 
must have been sour anyway.
Moral: Nothing comes easy, do not hate what you can’t have.
4. The Proud Rose
In the desert existed a rose and a cactus. The beautiful rose would take every 
opportunity to insult the cactus. The other plants tried to defend the cactus, 
but the rose was too obsessed with its own looks. There was no water during a 
particularly hot summer. The rose started to wither away. But the cactus had 
become a source of water for sparrows. The rose asked the cactus for water, and 
the nice cactus readily agreed.
Moral: Never judge someone according to how they look.

more money by buying a chicken and selling its eggs. She started to think how 
jealous she could make the other milkmaid with all the things she could buy from 
the milk and egg money. She started to skip in excitement, and soon the milk 
spilled over. She went home with empty pails and no money. Her mother then 
reminds her that she shouldn’t count her chicken until they hatch.

7. The Golden Egg
A farmer had a goose that laid one golden egg a day. He would sell the golden 
eggs, and they enjoyed a comfortable life. However, the farmer became greedy and 
wanted more than one egg a day. His wife foolishly agreed to his idea. The next 
day the farmer cut open the goose after it laid the golden egg. He could only 
find blood and guts. He realised his mistake. He now had no source of income, 
and the couple became poorer every day.
Moral: Think before you act.
8. The Farmer and the Well
A farmer bought a well from his neighbour to water his farm. The neighbour sold 
him the well but did not allow him to draw water from it. The farmer went to the 
emperor for justice. His courtier questioned the neighbour, who said that he had 
sold the well but not the water within it. The neighbour was told to either pay 
rent for the water to remove it all immediately. Realising that his trick didn’t 
work, he apologised and went home.
Moral: Cheating will get you nowhere.
9. Elephant and Friends
A lonely elephant was looking for friends in the forest. The monkey declined to 
be the elephant’s friend because the elephant could not swing in the trees. The 
rabbit turned the elephant because it was too big to fit in the burrow. The frog 
refused to be the elephant’s friend because it could not jump. Every other 
animal said no to the poor elephant. The next day, all the animals in the forest 
were running away in fear. The elephant stopped a bear who said that the tiger 
was attacking them all. The elephant nicely asked the tiger to stop, but the 
tiger told the elephant to stay out of the way. The elephant proceeded to kick 
the tiger and scare it away. The other animals then realised that the elephant 
was the perfect size to be their friend.
Moral: Friends can be any shape or size.

miser saw that all his gold was missing and started wailing. His neighbours came 
running and asked him what had happened. The neighbours asked him why he didn’t 
keep the gold in the house since it would be easy to access inside. The mise 
revealed he never planned on spending the gold. The neighbours told him he might 
as well save his stones, as the unused gold was just as useless.
Moral: A possession is important only if you use it.
17. The Dog At the Well
On a farm lived a mother dog and her pups. The mother dog warned her pups to 
never play near the well. However, one curious puppy decided to peek over the 
well. He saw his own reflection in the well and assumed it was another dog. He 
started barking at his reflection as he thought the other dog was imitating him.
