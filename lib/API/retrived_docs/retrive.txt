Introduction to CRT
● CRT stands for Cathode Ray Tube.
● A cathode ray tube (CRT) is a specialized vacuum tube in which images
areproduced when an electron beam strikes a phosphorescent surface.
● CRT is a technology used in traditional computer monitors and televisions.
● In television and computer, the entire front area of the tube is scanned repetitively
and systematically in a fixed pattern called a raster.
● The image on CRT display is created by firing electrons from the back of the tube of
phosphorus located towards the front of the screen.
● Once the electron heats the phosphorus, they light up, and they are projected on a
screen.
● The color you view on the screen is produced by a blend of red, blue and green light.

Architecture of CRT

The primary components are the heated metal cathode and a control grid.
The heat is supplied to the cathode (by passing a current through the filament).  This way the electrons get heated up  
and ejected out of the cathode filament.
This stream of negatively charged electrons is accelerated towards the phosphor screen by supplying a high positive  
voltage.
This acceleration is generally produced by  means of an accelerating anode.
The next component is the Focusing System, which is used to force  the electron beam to converge to a small spot on  
the screen.
If there will not be any focusing system, the electrons will be scattered because  of their own repulsions and hence 
we  won’t get a sharp image of the object.
This focus can be either by means of electrostatic fields or magnetic fields.

Components of CRT
● 1. Electron Gun: Electron gun consisting of a series of elements, primarily a heating filament (heater) 
and a cathode. Theelectron gun creates a source of electrons which are focused into a narrow beam directed at the 
face of the CRT .
● 2. Control Electrode: It is used to turn the electron beam on and off.
● 3. Focusing system: It is used to create a clear picture by focusing the electrons into a narrow beam.
● 4. Deflection Yoke: It is used to control the direction of the electron beam. It creates an electric or 
magnetic field which willbend the electron beam as it passes through the area. In a conventional CRT, the yoke is linked to a sweep or 
scan generator.  The deflection yoke which is connected to the sweep generator creates a fluctuating electric or 
magnetic potential.● 5. Phosphorus-coated screen: The inside front surface of every CRT is coated with phosphors. 
Phosphors glow when a high-energy electron beam hits them. Phosphorescence is the term used to characterize the light given off by a 
phosphor after it  has been exposed to an electron beam.

Monochrome CRT
●
●
●
●
In the monochrome CRT, there is an electron gun.
The electron gun is located at the rear side of the CRT.
The electron gun generates an electron stream or beam by hot cathode
via thermionic emission through a heater inside.
The electron beam generated by electron gun must be controlled in two  
ways.
–
– Intensity - the number of electrons that should reach the phosphor  
coating. It is controlled by a pair of control coils
Position - the horizontal and vertical positions of the electron beam
●
●
The inner side of the front screen is coated with phosphor.
When an electron beam strikes this phosphor coating, it glows and we can 
 see it on the front side of the screen.
